Dialogue Centre has organized a facilitated multi-generational dialogue on topic of Velvet Revolution legacy, democracy and its current development in Slovakia. More than 30 participants shared their different opinions and views around current situation in Slovakia and they'd developed and improved their dialogue skills. It was our first event with citizens of Banská Bystrica and we got the impression that people there really cared!
